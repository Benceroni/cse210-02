# cse210-02 Hi-Lo Game

Are you willing to test your wits and luck? Play Hi-Lo, you won't be disappointed. The rules are simple. Look at each card drawn and guess if the next one will be higher or lower. If you are correct you will be awarded 100 points. If you are not 75 points will be taken. You start with 300 points. The game is over when you either surrender or run out of points.

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
